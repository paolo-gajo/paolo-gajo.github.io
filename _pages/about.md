I am a PhD candidate in **Natural Language Processing** at the Department of Interpreting and Translation of the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/). My research focuses on **graph neural networks** and **large language models** and their application to **procedural text understanding**, **dependency parsing**, and **information extraction**. My PhD thesis focuses specifically on the **adaptation of food recipes**, based on user dietary constraints.
I am supervised by **Prof. Alberto Barrón-Cedeño** at the University of Bologna, where I am also involved in supervising MA students, disseminating at local seminars, and teaching in reading groups at the Depa.
During my PhD, I am a **visiting researcher at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Canada)**, collaborating with **Prof. Hassan Sajjad** and the [Hypermatrix Team](https://hypermatrix.cs.dal.ca/).

### Research Interests
- LLM planning
- Procedural text understanding
- Information Extraction

### Recent Projects
- **Local Dish Semantic Recommendation System** – Semantic querying of Italian regional recipes.
- **GIARA** – Realia-aware restaurant menu adaptation.
- **Automatic Subtitle Segmenter** – Automatic subtitle segmentation model.

### Invited Talks
- *Dependency Parsing on Procedural Texts*, Osaka University, 2025  
- *Geometric Deep Learning Lecture*, Dalhousie University, 2025  
- *Culinary Recipe Understanding and Adaptation*, Expo 2025, Osaka
