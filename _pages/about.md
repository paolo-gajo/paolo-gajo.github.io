I am a PhD candidate in **Natural Language Processing** at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/), working on the intersection of **graph neural networks** and **large language models**.  
My research focuses on **semantic dependency parsing**, **information extraction**, and the **understanding of graph-structured texts**, with a specific interest in their application to **culinary recipe adaptation** based on user dietary constraints.

During my PhD, I am a **visiting researcher at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Canada)**, collaborating with **Prof. Hassan Sajjad** on **graph-based NLP** and **text-to-graph models**.  
I am supervised by **Prof. Alberto Barrón-Cedeño** at the University of Bologna, where I am also involved in teaching, supervision, and reviewing for **ACL Rolling Review (ARR)**.

### Research Interests
- Natural Language Processing  
- Graph Neural Networks  
- Large Language Models  
- Information Extraction

### Recent Projects
- **Local Dish Semantic Recommendation System** – Semantic querying of regional recipes using graph-based models.  
- **GIARA** – Gastronomy and AI for a welcoming Romagna Region.  
- **Automatic Subtitle Segmenter** – Seq2Seq model for automatic subtitle segmentation.  

### Invited Talks
- *Dependency Parsing on Procedural Texts*, Osaka University, 2025  
- *Geometric Deep Learning Lecture*, Dalhousie University, 2025  
- *Culinary Recipe Understanding and Adaptation*, Expo 2025, Osaka
