    abstract = "Spotting hate speech in social media posts is crucial to increase the civility of the Web and has been thoroughly explored in the NLP community. For the first time, we introduce a multilingual corpus for the analysis and identification of hate speech in the domain of inceldom, built from incel Web forums in English and Italian, including expert annotation at the post level for two kinds of hate speech: misogyny and racism. This resource paves the way for the development of mono- and cross-lingual models for (a) the identification of hateful (misogynous and racist) posts and (b) the forecasting of the amount of hateful responses that a post is likely to trigger. Our experiments aim at improving the performance of Transformer-based models using masked language modeling pre-training and dataset merging. The results show that these strategies boost the models{'} performance in all settings (binary classification, multi-label classification and forecasting), especially in the cross-lingual scenarios.",

abstract = {Research on knowledge graph construction (KGC) has recently shown great promise also thanks to the adoption of large language models (LLM) for the automatic extraction of structured information from raw text. However, most works rely on commercial, closed-source LLMs, hindering reproducibility and accessibility. We explore KGC with smaller, open-weight LLMs and investigate whether they can be used to improve upon the results obtained by systems leveraging bigger, closed-source models. Specifically, we focus on CodeKGC, a prompting framework based on GPT-3.5. We choose a variety of models either pre-trained primarily on natural language or on code and fine-tune them on three datasets used for information extraction. We fine-tune with prompts formatted either in natural language or as Python-like scripts. In addition, we optionally train the models with prompts including chain-of-thought sections. After fine-tuning, the choice of coding vs natural language prompts has a limited impact on performance, while chain-of-thought training mostly leads to a performance decrease. Moreover, we show that a LLM can be outperformed by much smaller versions on this task, after undergoing the same amount of training. We find that in general the selected lightweight LLMs outperform the much larger CodeKGC by as much as 15–20 absolute F1 points after fine-tuning. The results show that state-of-the-art KGC systems can be developed using smaller and open-weight models, enhancing research transparency, lowering compute requirements, and decreasing third-party API reliance.
